# README

This is a web site set up to provide information about competitions that new members in APO go through at the Alpha Alpha chapter. The 3 types of challenges are throwdowns, spoon wars, and photo challenges.

I built the site in RoR mainly just so I could use html partials. The site doesn't have any backend features, but you might see some legacy code related to features I was considering implementing.
