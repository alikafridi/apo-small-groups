<h2>Photo Challenge Rules</h2>
<ul class="lead">
	<li>Photos must be submitted by 11:59pm on Friday night on the pledge class facebook group</li>
	<li>Photos can count for multiple groups if their members are present, just include the names of all pledges and their small groups.</li>
	<li>Each week's challenges will be announced on the Facebook group by the end of the night on Sunday.</li>
	<li>Only one submission will count per small group. You can take more if you'd like but they won't add to your points.</li>
